# FutureLearn "Learn to Code for Data Analysis"
---

Jupyter Notebooks [of both exercises and projects] and other notes of FutureLearn MOOC "Learn to Code for Data Analysis".


## Introduction
Jupyter Notebooks [of both exercises and projects] and other notes of FutureLearn MOOC for [Learn to Code for Data Analysis](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/learn-to-code) by Michel Wermelinger, Rob Griffiths & Tony Hirst in association with The Open University (OU).<br>
This course is of 4 weeks duration. I took this course when it ran the first time starting on 08th May, 2017.<br>

There are quizzes on every important topic, and also a decent number of hands-on exercises and one project in each week in this course.


## Topics
* Python: variables, assignments, expressions, basic data types, if-statement, functions
* Programming: using Jupyter Notebooks, writing readable and documented code, testing code
* Data analysis: using pandas to read CSV and Excel files, to clean, filter, partition, aggregate and summarise data, and to produce simple charts

## Jupyter notebooks online viewer
All the Jupyter notebooks of this repo can be browsed online either here with GitHub or with *nbviewer* app of _jupyter.org_.
[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/P7h/FutureLearn__Learn_to_Code_for_Data_Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/P7h/FutureLearn__Learn_to_Code_for_Data_Analysis)

Notebooks render beautifully on *nbviewer* and shows the output cells as well as options for downloading the corresponding notebook, etc.


## Course URL

## Local env setup
In case you do not have the modules used in the notebook or jupyter installed, simply type the following on the terminal.

	pip install -r reqs.txt

Then run the notebook from terminal using the below command.

	jupyter notebook


### Jupyter Notebook Extensions
Please also install [Jupyter Notebook Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions), a collection of extensions that add functionality to the Jupyter notebook.

	conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

Or if you are using `pip`:

	pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions


And then follow the steps mentioned in the instructions [here](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions#installation).
